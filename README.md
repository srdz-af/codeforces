Codeforces Submissions
This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems that I've attempted. Each solution is organized by the problem code/title.

Folder Structure
[Official and virtual codeforces contests] Like "1914", solutions are named by the problem's letter letter, e.g. "A.cpp"
[Virtual ICPC contests] Like "104736", solutions are named by the contest code followed by the problem letter, e.g. "104736A.cpp"
[Gitgud and miscelaneous] Contains miscelaneous problems, named by the contest code followed by the problem letter, e.g. "1336A.cpp"

These solutions are for learning purposes and not intended for direct submission to Codeforces contests or copying during live contests. It's crucial to understand the problems and solve them on your own before referring to any solutions.
